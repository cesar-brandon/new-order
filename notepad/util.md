# Utilities of Command-Controlled Applications

Applications that can be controlled by interpreting commands can be
useful in several contexts:

## Accessibility 🦆

For users with physical disabilities, the ability to control the user interface through
voice commands can be extremely useful. This can allow them to interact with the
application in a way they otherwise could not.

## Multitasking 🦆

Users who need to have their hands free, such as doctors, cooks, drivers, etc.,
can benefit from the ability to control an application through voice commands.

## Automation and Efficiency 🦆

Voice commands can allow users to perform complex or repetitive tasks more
efficiently. For example, a user could say "move all recent sales to the center"
instead of having to manually drag and drop each item.

## Natural Interaction 🦆

In some cases, voice commands can provide a more natural and intuitive way
to interact with an application. This can be especially true for users who
are not familiar with traditional user interfaces.

## Virtual and Augmented Reality Applications 🦆

In these environments, traditional user interfaces can be difficult to
implement or may not be practical. Voice commands can provide an effective
way to interact with these applications.
